warmup.py — download the local embedding model BEFORE class.

    python checkpoints/checkpoint-5-production-ingestion/warmup.py

The first embedding call downloads all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (about 80 MB) to
~/.cache/chroma. On slow Wi-Fi that takes minutes, so do it at home.
After that, everything in this checkpoint runs offline and free.
