# Router — pick the retrieval by the SHAPE of the question
# ============================================================
# Top-k is a budget. "Who works in our San Francisco office?" has six
# right answers, one per row of the team directory. Top-5 can return
# at most five of them, however good the embedding. No reranker,
# no HyDE, no prompt fixes that: the answer is bigger than k.
#
# Two shapes of question:
#   pointwise    the answer lives in one or two places
#                -> similarity search (hybrid + rerank)
#   aggregation  the answer is a SET scattered across records
#                ("who / how many / list everyone ... in <office>")
#                -> a structured lookup over the records: every match
#
# Here the classifier is a few rules, because the shapes are clear
# and rules are free, fast and testable. When rules can't tell, a
# small LLM call can classify. The lesson is the split, not the regex.
#
# In production the structured side is SQL over a table (or pandas
# over a sheet). Spreadsheets and directories are records, not prose.
